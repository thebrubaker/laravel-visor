## About Visor

Visor is a quick and simple way to get your next Laravel project running locally with Docker on Mac OS.

Install Visor globally with composer:

```bash
composer global require thebrubaker/laravel-visor:dev-linux
```

To use visor to spin up a new Laravel application, simply run `visor up`

Tip: If you are already familiar with Docker or Docker Compose, this tool is likely only useful for convenience.

## Visor Commands

```bash
visor up # spin up application
visor down # spin down application
visor migrate # run migrations
visor tinker # jump into your php container with a bash shell
visor compose ...args # run docker-compose commands
```

## Requirements

This tool requires Docker and should run on Mac OS. If you want to install the linux binary, you can require `thebrubaker/laravel-visor:dev-linux`

## Visor Errors

```

Visor exposes a mysql database on the port listed in your .env file. Please update DB_PORT to one available on your machine and try again.

Visor is a simple wrapper for docker-compose. Do you want us to backup your docker-compose config and replace it with Visor's config?

ðŸ’¥ Unable to access your application at http://localhost:8080
